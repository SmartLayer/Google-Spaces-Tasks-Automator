It tells you their early impact.\n\n2. **Use This Growth to Predict the Future**  \n   Start with real trade numbers from **August 2025 to May 2026**.  \n   Then, apply the **same % growth** you saw in June and July to each of those months to estimate **August 2026 to May 2027**.  \n   This gives you a full-year forecast.\n\n3. **Adjust for Diminishing Returns**  \n   After this, don’t expect growth to keep going up by the same % every year.  \n   Over time, the new management’s effect will fade.  \n   So for each month after May 2027, you should still see higher numbers than the same month the year before—but the % increase should be smaller.",

        "text": "I have conducted three interviews. \nThe first candidate  Terry Park is a young woman from Korea who is working on a Work & Travel visa. At the moment, she is the head barista in a French café. She wants to change jobs because she doesn’t have enough working hours and is looking for a full-time position. She is interested in starting in September, when she buys a car and will be able to travel to Historic Rivermill from South Port (if there is anybody from South Port who can she come with she is happy to share fuel). She also asked if we provide meals at work (for her its important part since she always had this conditions in previous her work palces) . She has more than one year of barista experience. She trains all the staff, creates new cocktails for the menu, and develops new items.\n\nThe second candidate is Yasmin, from Australia. She is a young mother. She is ready to come on Saturday, 23 August, at 9 a.m. for a trial day. She has very good experience as a manager, but for now she is not sure about her skills. She would like to try first as a waitress, but she is open to becoming a manager in the future. After speaking with her, I had the impression that she is quite ambitious. She has education in management and is finishing her last year of studies, which is a very good sign for us. She also has experience working as a manager. I explained to her all the responsibilities of a manager in Historic Rivermill: coordinating work and communication between the kitchen and bar, solving guest issues, guest service, answering questions about events such as birthdays and weddings. This would be a new experience for her, but she is ready to try. She can come for the trial day on 23 August, Saturday.\n\nThe third candidates are a couple from Belgium: Ruben, 30, and Charlotte, 27. They are ready to start work from 1 September. They want to work as waiters because they don’t have much experience as managers. Charlotte has a little experience leading small groups, but not enough to be a manager with us. Ruben worked in a bakery and also as a waiter, but he also doesn’t have enough experience for a manager role. However, they are a very ambitious young couple, ready to learn and work. They are on a Work & Travel visa and asked if there is a possibility to apply for an extension while working with us. They plan to live in a trailer, have a parking slot if possible, and asked if there is a place to take a shower or if we can provide accommodation for a certain payment.\n\nThe fourth candidate is Verity, who did not attend the interview (and i was also little late) but sent me an email saying she is available tomorrow for a face-to-face interview and is waiting for a reply. According to her CV, she has a background as a manager. We need to conduct an interview with her and see if she is suitable for our manager position.",

Furthermore she hasn't been trained to do this work which is against insurance policy requirement that all people who work with horses has to have experience with horse work or need to be trained. Given Tuesday 2 other typical horse girls are already rostered you are confused and ask for Sam to be let go on that day.",

Confirmation of Public Liability Cover\nBased on the policy wording and clarification from the insurance broker, the Equine Combined Liability Policy_01112020 includes Public Liability insurance.\n\nThis provides cover for:\n\n\nThird-party injury\n\n\nThird-party property damage\n\nresulting from business activities declared and insured under this policy.\n\n\n\n2. Analysis of Past Incidents\na) Customer bitten by a bat\n\nIncident details: Occurred during a supervised animal interaction session.\n\n\nCoverage assessment: Covered, as this is a third-party injury directly connected to a declared business activity.\n\n\nDocumentation required: Incident report, signed waiver, and any demands from the third party.\n\n\nb) Landlord fatality from snake bite\n\nIncident details: Landowner fatally bitten by a snake on the property.\n\n\nCoverage assessment: Not covered. The broker advised that this would not fall under the Landowner Indemnity extension, as it was not a result of insured business activities. Compensation would instead fall under the landowner’s own private health or life insurance.\n\n\nDocumentation required: N/A (claim not applicable).\n\n\nc) Visitor ankle injury from slippery surface\n\nIncident details: Occurred on-site, potentially involving the turtle feeding area.\n\n\nCoverage assessment: Covered, as this constitutes a third-party injury arising from conditions on site during business activities.\n\n\nDocumentation required: Incident report, signed waiver, and any demands from the third party.\n\n\n\n3. Conclusion\nThe Equine Combined Liability Policy_01112020 includes Public Liability cover. Based on the broker’s clarification:\n\n\nCovered incidents:\n\n\nCustomer bitten by a bat\n\n\nVisitor ankle injury from slippery surface\n\n\n\nNot covered incident:\n\n\nLandlord fatality from snake bite (not linked to insured business activities)\n\n\n\nAll future incidents require full supporting documentation (incident reports, waivers, third-party demands) to be considered under this policy.",
